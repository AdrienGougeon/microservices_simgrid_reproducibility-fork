  We evaluate the application on 2 configurations:
  - configuration 1: 1 node executes the services included in the execution
    of the compose request, the other node executes the other services so
    that it does not affect the performance of our benchmark.
    To do so, take the file [[./resources/awkfile_1.awk]] and set the hostname of
    your node that will execute the services. Then, use this file on the
    template in [[./resources/docker_compose_2.yml]] to generate the
    docker-compose file to launch the experiment.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       
    #+END_SRC
  - configuration 2: we have 2 nodes each executing 6 of the services
    included in the execution of the compose request, and the third node
    executes the other services.
